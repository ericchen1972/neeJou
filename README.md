# neeJou

neeJou is an AI-powered matchmaking platform that connects project owners with the right engineers.

## What This Project Does

Project owners can describe their needs in natural language, and the system turns those ideas into a clear project profile. Engineers can sign in with GitHub and use real contribution history to show what they have actually done. The platform then helps match both sides based on project fit.

## Why neeJou

- Clear project communication: turns broad requests into structured requirements.
- Better matching quality: focuses on real fit instead of self-promotion.
- Trust through evidence: uses repository contribution context to support credibility.
- Faster decision-making: gives owners a practical shortlist for the next step.
- Built for both sides: owners save time, engineers get fairer visibility.

## Product Value

neeJou reduces the gap between "what a client wants" and "who can deliver it". It helps teams start with clearer expectations and better-aligned talent from day one.
